## About Me

I have been an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Engineering at Konkuk University since 2025. [Homepage](https://sites.google.com/view/trustworthy-ml/home?authuser=0/)

I received my bachelor's degree in 2020 and my Ph.D. in 2024, both from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Seoul National University.

## Research Interests

My Research interest lies in constructing **_Trustworthy AI_**, focusing on key aspects such as

- **Privacy**
  - Data Privacy, Privacy-preserving Generative Models
- **Security**
  - Verifiable Computing, Finding and Mitigating Adversarial Attacks
- **Fairness**
  - Max-Min Fairness, Counterfactual Fairness
- **Reliability**
  - Distributed Computing, Network Pruning
- **Explainability**
  - Explainable AI
